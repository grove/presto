Presto is an editing framework. 

The idea behind it is that you can declare the rules for an editable object model in a schema, and then create and update data conforming to this schema using a data provider implementation. A schema is exposed through a schema provider and the data is updated through a data provider. By default the values of an object field is stored with the object itself, but there is a field resolver API that lets you pull in data from anywhere.

The framework consists of an SPI for schema providers, data providers and field resolvers. There is also a JAX/RS application that provides a REST interface for accessing and updating data.
