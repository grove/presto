0.7.0

- The major change in this release is full support for inline topics.
  Inline topics are stored in the same document as their ancestors.
  They implement the PrestoTopic interface just like ordinary topics.

- Client side filtering with 'available-field-values' links. Uses URI
  template to do this. This can be used to implement autosuggest fields.

- Now able to explicitly specify type.defaultView, and type.createView,
  and field.editView and field.createView. This makes it easier to
  customize which view to use in different scenarios.
